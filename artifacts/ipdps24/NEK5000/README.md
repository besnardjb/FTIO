# NEK5000

The trace can be downloaded directly from: <https://hpcioanalysis.zdv.uni-mainz.de/trace/64ed13e0f9a07cf8244e45cc>, or can be found in `data/application_traces/NEK5000` after extracting [data.zip](/artifacts/ipdps24/README.md#extracting-the-data-set).

After downloading, rename the file to `nek_2048.darshan`. `ftio` can now be called on the complete trace via:

```sh
ftio nek_2048.darshan
```

pass the `-e no` flag to avoid generating plots and just directly obtaining the result from `ftio` on the command line:

```
ftio nek_2048.darshan -e no
```

To limit the time window to 56,000 s, pass the `-te 56000` flag as follows:

```
ftio nek_2048.darshan  -te 56000 -e no
```
