# Tools
Aside from [`ftio`](https://github.com/tuda-parallel/FTIO#usage) or [`predictor`](https://github.com/tuda-parallel/FTIO/blob/main/docs/approach.md#online-prediction), the FTIO repository offers several more tools for various purposes: 

- [`ioplot`](#ioplot) generates interactive plots in HTML
- [`parse`](#parse) parses and merges several traces to an [Extra-P](https://github.com/extra-p/extrap) supported file format

## ioplot
This tool generates interactive plots using Plotly. Supported file formats are described [here](./file_formats.md)

## ioparse
